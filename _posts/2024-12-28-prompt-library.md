Time is our most precious commodity. Whether you're a software engineer, content creator, or product manager, repetitive tasks often drain our time and energy—time better spent on innovation and strategy. That’s why I built the **Prompt Repository**: a modular, reusable system designed to automate complex workflows, streamline repetitive tasks, and unlock creativity with the help of carefully crafted prompts and Jupyter notebooks.

This repository isn’t just a collection of prompts; it’s a productivity booster designed to make your work simpler, faster, and smarter.

## **The Problem: Repetition and Complexity**

As a professional working with natural language processing tools, I noticed a recurring challenge: every time I needed to generate release notes, summarize a complex report, or craft high-quality content, I was starting from scratch. Even though tools like GPT-4 are incredibly powerful, they still require well-structured prompts to deliver the best results. Crafting and refining those prompts takes time—a lot of it.

I realized that having a **centralized system of reusable prompts** tailored to common workflows could eliminate this inefficiency. Pair that with the versatility of Jupyter notebooks, and you have a powerful platform that turns repetitive tasks into seamless, automated processes.

## **Introducing the Prompt Repository**

The **Prompt Repository** is a thoughtfully designed toolkit that combines:
- **Reusable YAML-based prompts**: Structured prompts for specific tasks like summarization, paraphrasing, and more.
- **Jupyter notebooks**: Complete end-to-end solutions for accomplishing common jobs to be done like generating release notes, extracting key insights from a research paper or writing a blog article.
- **API integrations**: Connect your favorite NLP tools (like OpenAI's GPT models) to supercharge the results.

## **What Makes It Unique?**

### 1. **Reusability**  
Every prompt in the repository is stored in YAML format, making it easy to read, edit, and adapt to new tasks. These prompts are designed to be modular, meaning you can mix and match them to create custom workflows.

### 2. **Automation**  
By integrating these prompts into Jupyter notebooks, I’ve automated complex workflows. For example, generating a polished list of release notes from raw Jira data or crafting blog articles from a simple outline can now be done in minutes.

### 3. **Ease of Use**  
Whether you're a developer or a non-technical professional, the repository is intuitive. It includes:
- Clear documentation for setup and usage.
- Example prompts and notebooks tailored to real-world scenarios.
- A supporting `secrets.yaml` system to manage API keys securely.

## **How to Use the Prompt Repository**

Here’s how you can get started with the Prompt Repository and harness its full potential:

### Step 1: **Set Up the Environment**
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Launch Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

### Step 2: **Select a Workflow**
Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder. Each notebook is tailored for a specific task. For example:
- **Jira Release Notes Notebook**: Input an export of Jira tickets, and the notebook generates a polished, professional list of release notes.
- **Article Ghost Writer Notebook**: Provide a topic or key points, and the notebook generates a high-quality draft blog article.

### Step 3: **Run the Notebook**
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook. It will guide you through loading prompts, connecting to APIs, and processing your data.
