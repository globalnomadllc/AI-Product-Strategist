## **Why Automate Your Release Notes?**

Release notes are the unsung hero of product communication. They keep your stakeholders informed, reduce tickets by addressing known changes or fixes, and build transparency and trust with users.

And yet, most release notes are either overly technical or vague, and creating them manually can take hours. That’s where automation steps in. The Jira Release Notes Generator uses powerful AI tools to free up your time for what really matters—shipping great products.

Time is your most valuable resource. With the Jira Release Notes Generator, you can:

- Save Hours: Automate what used to take half a day.
- Increase Accuracy: Say goodbye to manual errors and inconsistencies.
- Delight Your Stakeholders: Provide clear, professional updates that everyone can understand.

This isn’t just a productivity tool—it’s a game-changer for anyone managing software releases.

## **How the Jira Release Notes Generator Works**

Using Jira exports or direct API integration to fetch issue data, the Jira Release Notes Generator summarizes each issue with OpenAI’s GPT-4.  From there, it organizes them into categories like “Bug Fixes” or “Feature Enhancements.” The result? A set of clean, concise, and professionally-formatted HTML release notes you can copy-paste into emails, blogs, or documentation.

### **Features**

The Jira Release Notes Generator gives you:

- **Flexibility:** Works with both CSV exports and live API calls from Jira.
- **Automation:** Generates concise, single-sentence release notes tailored for non-technical audiences.
- **Categorization:** Automatically organizes notes into intuitive sections for clarity.
- **Customization:** Define your own categories, adjust prompts, and tweak formatting.

## **Step-by-Step Guide: Using the Release Notes Generator**

### **Option 1: Using a CSV Export**

If you prefer a manual approach:
1. Log in to your Jira account.
2. Use a JQL query like this to filter your issues:
   ```sql
   project = "GNP" AND labels = release_notes AND fixversion = 12-13-2024 ORDER BY key DESC, created DESC
   ```
3. Export the results as a CSV file and save it to your system.
4. Set the `DATA_SOURCE` variable in the notebook to `"csv"`.
5. Update the `CSV_FILE_PATH` with the path to your export file.

---

### **Option 2: Using the Jira API**

For a fully automated experience:
1. Generate an API token from your Jira account.
2. Update the following variables in the notebook:
   - `JIRA_BASE_URL`
   - `JIRA_EMAIL`
   - `JIRA_API_TOKEN`
   - `JQL_QUERY`
3. Set the `DATA_SOURCE` variable to `"api"`. The notebook will handle the rest.

---

### **Run the Notebook**
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode.
2. Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Execute the cells in order, customizing variables as needed.
4. View your beautifully formatted release notes, ready for publication!

## **Example Output**

Here’s what the generated release notes look like (you can customize this output in the notebook to fit your style and formatting requirements):

```html
<p>
  The most recent product release became effective on <strong>July 7th, 2025</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>General Bug Fixes and Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a transparency issue within a dropdown on user home page.</li>
  <li>Restored the functionality of the unordered list button in the rich text editor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated user input fields to better sanitize HTML code.</li>
</ul>
```

You can copy and paste this HTML directly into your documentation, email templates, or web pages.
