**Let’s face it—writing release notes is tedious.** You’ve just finished juggling development deadlines, testing cycles, and last-minute bug fixes, and now you’re tasked with the thankless job of summarizing everything for your stakeholders. It’s boring. It’s time-consuming. And let’s be honest, it’s the first thing everyone ignores after it lands in their inbox.

That’s why I created the **Jira Release Notes Generator**—an automated tool that transforms raw Jira data into polished, audience-friendly release notes in minutes. Whether you're managing a small project or running an enterprise-level release, this tool simplifies your process, saves you hours of manual work, and ensures your updates are both professional and engaging.

## **Why Automate Your Release Notes?**

Release notes are the unsung hero of product communication. They:
- Keep stakeholders informed.
- Reduce support tickets by addressing known changes or fixes.
- Build transparency and trust with users.

Yet, most release notes are either overly technical or vague to the point of uselessness. Worse, creating them manually can take hours you don’t have. That’s where automation steps in. The **Jira Release Notes Generator** combines the power of Jira’s API, OpenAI’s GPT models, and a streamlined categorization system to automate this process, freeing up your time for what really matters—shipping great products.

## **How the Jira Release Notes Generator Works**

This tool uses **Jira exports** or direct **API integration** to fetch issue data, summarizes each issue with OpenAI’s GPT-4, and organizes them into categories you define like *Security* or *General Bug Fixes*. The result? A set of clean, concise, and professionally formatted HTML release notes you can copy-paste into emails, blogs, or documentation.

### **Features at a Glance**

1. **Flexibility**: Works with both CSV exports and live API calls from Jira.
2. **Automation**: Generates concise, single-sentence release notes tailored for non-technical audiences.
3. **Categorization**: Automatically organizes notes into intuitive sections for clarity.
4. **Customizable**: Define your own categories, adjust prompts, and tweak formatting.

## **Step-by-Step Guide: Using the Release Notes Generator**

### **Option 1: Using a CSV Export**

If you prefer a manual approach:
1. Log in to your Jira account.
2. Use a JQL query like this to filter your issues:
   ```sql
   project = "GNP" AND labels = release_notes AND fixversion = 12-13-2024 ORDER BY key DESC, created DESC
   ```
3. Export the results as a CSV file and save it to your system.
4. Set the `DATA_SOURCE` variable in the notebook to `"csv"`.
5. Update the `CSV_FILE_PATH` with the path to your export file.

### **Option 2: Using the Jira API**

For a fully automated experience:
1. Generate an API token from your Jira account.
2. Update the following variables in the notebook:
   - `JIRA_BASE_URL`
   - `JIRA_EMAIL`
   - `JIRA_API_TOKEN`
   - `JQL_QUERY`
3. Set the `DATA_SOURCE` variable to `"api"`. The notebook will handle the rest.

---

### **Run the Notebook**
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode.
2. Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Execute the cells in order, customizing variables as needed.
4. View your beautifully formatted release notes, ready for publication!

## **Example Output**

Here’s what the generated release notes look like (you can customize this output in the notebook to fit your style and formatting requirements):

```html
<p>
  The most recent product release became effective on <strong>July 7th, 2025</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>General Bug Fixes and Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a transparency issue within a dropdown on user home page.</li>
  <li>Restored the functionality of the unordered list button in the rich text editor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated user input fields to better sanitize HTML code.</li>
</ul>
```

You can copy and paste this HTML directly into your documentation, email templates, or web pages.
